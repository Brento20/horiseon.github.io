## Accessibility and web Optimization 

 - I added device width to the head meta HTML to improve readability on mobile and added a meta discription to help with general SEO. 
 - Matched the page < title > to the < H1 > to optimise for google.
 - Organised the H tags 1-6 where appropiate.
 - Added "alt" text to images.
- Added device width to the head meta HTML to improve readability on mobile and added a meta discription to help with general SEO. Images in the assest folder were too large and slowed loading speed, the original images are still in ./asset incase we need to revert but are not linked in the HTML and "-min" was added to new file names to identify compressed files.
